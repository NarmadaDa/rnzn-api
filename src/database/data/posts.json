    "content": "<p>I'm very excited to be able to announce the official launch of HomePort – the mobile app that has all the key information you need to know about the Navy you serve in.</p><p>The entire contents of the Divisional Handbook (NZBR 9) can now be accessed onto your mobile or tablet. Personal Admin and Divisional Documentation can be found along with detail on our Fleet, Force for Families, Force Financial Hub, Dress & Appearance, Career Management, Trade/Branch Changes, key contacts, Navy's Facebook page and a whole lot more.</p><p>With HomePort on your device, you now have access to the most important information without needing DIXS, without having to RAS in or without having to call someone. It's all there. On your phone. 24/7.</p><p>For full access to HomePort, ensure your details are correct on ESS – particularly your personal email. It's from ESS that full access is granted. Go onto the NZDF ILP page and click on ESS to make sure you're good to go.</p><p>HomePort is a fantastic tool and I thank all of those who had a role to play in its development. I hope you find it adds real value to you as you navigate your way around our Navy.</p><p>Myself, DCN and MCC filmed a short video with assistance from talented people in Navy staff in Defence House at the link below.</p><p>https://vimeo.com/527586514/b7ef684f6d</p><p>Yours Aye<br/>Rear Admiral David Proctor,<br/>Chief of Navy</p>"
