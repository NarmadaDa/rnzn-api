                "content": "<h3>Protecting trade routes, preventing piracy and terrorism</h3><p>New Zealand's economic prosperity is reliant on a stable political environment and safe maritime trade routes. Nearly all of our country's exports (99% by weight) and most of our imports are transported by sea.  Threats to shipping, such as piracy or blockade, have affected our economy in the past and could do so again.</p><p>New Zealand is a valued regional security partner and our Navy works collaboratively with other Navies to protect our region's valuable maritime trade routes. In recent years Navy ships and people have deployed to the Arabian Gulf and Horn of Africa where we contribute to international efforts to protect trade routes and prevent piracy and terrorism. New Zealand continues to invest in strengthening regional architecture that helps protect the rights of small states and enhances stability, security and free access to global commons.</p><h3>Border patrol and resource protection</h3><p>Navy ships and people protect our country's interests with regular border and fisheries patrols, search and rescue operations, as well as supporting the Police, Civil Defence and the Department of Conservation.  Two Inshore Patrol Vessels work around the New Zealand coast and two Offshore Patrol Vessels do similar work in the Southern Ocean and Pacific.</p><h3>Humanitarian and Disaster Relief missions</h3><p>The Navy is ready and capable of responding to natural disasters at home and abroad.  Navy ships and people were among the first responders to the devastating Christchurch earthquake in February 2011 and again in 2016.  Navy ships are ready to undertake search and rescue missions and are active in the South Pacific where ships of the Naval Patrol Force regularly undertake fisheries patrols, visit ports and contribute to humanitarian missions such as cyclone relief or transporting supplies to remote islands, an example of this is when Cyclone Winston hit Fiji in 2015.</p><h3>Peacekeeping</h3><p>Navy personnel take part in peacekeeping operations around the world.  Navy ships and people have been deployed to Timor-Leste, Solomon Islands, Sudan, the Middle-East, South Korea and Afghanistan.</p><h3>Specialist Underwater Operations</h3><p>Navy maintains a modern, deployable specialist underwater operational and survey capability.  The Operational Dive Team and Littoral Warfare Support Force are capable of military and civilian tasks, including search and recovery, and deploy to incidents within New Zealand and overseas.</p><iframe height='300' src='https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gwUIPrERL6Y?showinfo=0&rel=0&iv_load_policy=3&color=white&disablekb=1' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe>"

We have the ninth longest coastline in the world. Our nearest major trading partner and ally, Australia, is 1,000 miles away. We are a vast distance from most major international markets and 99% of our trade crosses the sea. New Zealand's economic interests rest upon our ability to ensure safe passage at sea and the security of the waters over which we have a sovereign right. Through our geographical isolation and dependence on maritime trade, it is clear that New Zealand is a maritime nation.</p><p>The Navy's readiness to deploy provides the Government with an important tool to respond quickly to emergency situations around New Zealand's 15,000-kilometre coastline, the Southern Ocean and into the Asia-Pacific region.</p>"

It is people, it is people, it is people.</p><p>Our people are managed by a unique system that cannot be defined as being solely management, command or leadership-based. Dating back to its 1755 UK origins, the Divisional System is an ever evolving, responsive and complex network of internal and external support which prioritises people rather than processes.  The spirit of the Divisional System relies on mutual respect, trust, and a genuine desire to look out for, and do the best for each other.  The divisional relationship is a partnership; your division may be led by a Divisional Officer and guided by a Divisional Supervisor, but you share the responsibility for your own professional and personal welfare with them.</p><img src='https://oracle-static.aviato.co.nz/content/divisional-system-diagram-1.png' />"

                "content": "<h4>Assistant Divisional Officers</h4><p>Whilst a lot of divisional work may require common sense rather than formal learning, you as an ADO do not have the authority or training to complete divisional work until you have completed DMC. Your role as an ADO is to work as the DO's understudy and receive on-the-job experience and coaching; you are not expected or permitted to assume and fulfil the DO's duties - the responsibility for all aspects of divisional management remains with the DO.</p><p>However, you will play an integral role in being the eyes and the ears for the DO. Building relationships with divisional members and learning what motivates them personally and professionally will not only be an immeasurable skill set for your future as a DO, but it will also assist the current DO with any emergent divisional matters.</p><p>Divisional Supervisors are likely to have banked more life experience, and certainly more organisational knowledge than you. Ask them! It can be daunting and awkward navigating a working relationship with your Divisional Supervisor - there is likely to be an age gap and you are both working out your expectations of each other. But, this is one relationship always worth pursuing and maintaining for the remainder of your divisional management career.</p><h4>Divisional Officers</h4><p>The DO is to be held accountable for making the divisional system work effectively, paying particular attention to the development of subordinates (Officers - ADOs; Senior Rates - senior POs). DOs are responsible for coaching and providing learning opportunities for their juniors, in order to better prepare them for their DMC courses and most importantly, their future as Dos/Div Supervisors. Exposure to your thought processes is essential for their professional development. This requires role modelling, patience, understanding and consistency.</p><p>More experienced DOs are also obliged to assist and act as sounding boards for newly appointed DOs. You've stood in those shoes - you've been the junior DO applying classroom-based scenario learning to real-life complex divisional situations that you haven't encountered before. So, you need to demonstrate empathy, approachableness and offer your time to support their learning - you are mentoring your future relief!</p><h4>Divisional Supervisors</h4><p>ADOs and junior DOs may not necessarily ask directly for your guidance. They are likely to already be feeling the pressure to get things right the first time every time. Having your support in creating an environment where the 'baby DOs' can learn the ropes without fear of making mistakes, will be gratefully received. The opportunity to learn from your experience and counsel will make them better DOs and our talented people will benefit from your shared advocacy.</p><p>As DOs become more senior in both rank and position, their relatability to the younger divisional members will naturally decrease, cementing the necessity for a solid DO-Div Supervisor relationship. Your ongoing 'finger on the pulse' and personal knowledge of the division (and its dynamics) will be paramount to the cohesion and morale of the division.</p><h4>ADOs, DOs and Div Supervisors</h4><p>A DMC qual does not complete your divisional training. It is expected that you will continue to aim to 'be better' for the duration of your divisional career - Lead Self Value Add: Mastery of Technical/Professional Competence.</p><p><u>Update</u>. The rate of change in our organisation is considerable and new policies or amendments to existing policies are released frequently; often with little fanfare or wide dissemination. Consequently procedural changes and new processes can be easily missed, leading to confusion and inevitable frustration. You have an obligation to your divisional members to stay on top of updates and new info as best you can.</p><ul><li>Even if you've checked a reference recently, check it again before advising a divisional member just in case it's been updated in the interim.</li><li>Check this app as this will be updated at least 6 monthly with the latest info and announcements.</li><li>Ask a fellow DO/Div Supervisor if you know that they have just worked through a similar issue (remaining mindful of Staff-in-Confidence breaches).</li><li>Contact the HRSC or FPTO Writers if the info you seek falls within their remit (contact details are provided in the 'Divisional Support' chapter).</li><li>Contact the Divisional Training Officer at the Leadership Development Group - <a href='mailto:DivisionalManagement@nzdf.mil.nz'>DivisionalManagement@nzdf.mil.nz</a></li></ul><p><u>Upskill</u>. Divisional Conferences are held regularly at DNB. These provide up-to-the-minute information from senior leadership and units across the Navy about changes and emerging issues on the horizon. Wherever possible, attend! It is not 'a waste of time' if you leave the conference with just one piece of information to pass on to your divisional members, or having learnt just one tip to better perform your divisional duties. If attendance numbers permit, consider taking along one of your divisional 'trainees (ADO/Divisional Supervisor) for their exposure to the information but also the conferences.</p><img src='https://oracle-static.aviato.co.nz/content/training-expectations-diagram-1.png' /><img src='https://oracle-static.aviato.co.nz/content/training-expectations-diagram-2.png' />"

If the complainant is not satisfied with the handling of their complaint/decision, the complainant may elevate the complaint in successive order up the divisional chain e.g. DO - CO - CN or COMJFNZ (if complainant is on an OE16 mission) - CDF - Governor General.</p><p>The HR Toolkit provides flowcharts outlining the NZDF complaints processes for complaints elevated to the CO level and those elevated to CN or higher (Level 2).</p><p><strong>Q. What is the format for a complaint?</strong><br/>Complaints may be either verbal or in writing. Although where possible complaints should be in writing. There is no set format as to how a complaint should be drafted.</p><p>A complainant may personally request the assistance of any NZDF member in drafting a complaint. If at any time the complainant formally requests assistance, and they have no preference as to who, the CO is to appoint an officer, WO or NCO to assist. This includes a member of Civil Staff if the Civil Staff member agrees.</p><p><strong>Q. What if I want to withdraw or make changes to a complaint after I've submitted it?</strong><br/>A complainant has the right, at any time and without explanation, to withdraw all or part of a complaint. At any time during the investigation of a complaint, or when requesting that the complaint be forwarded to the next superior officer, the complainant may provide additional information concerning the complaint or change the redress sought.</p><h3>Investigating complaints</h3><p>Should you make a complaint, it is to go to your DO in the first instance. They are obliged to investigate the complaint or have it investigated as soon as practicable, and to provide a redress as appropriate given the circumstances of the complaint.</p><p>On receipt of a complaint, a DO has the following decisions to make:</p><ul><li>Does the complaint meet the content criteria?</li><li>Is the complaint capable of redress by an RNZN authority?</li><li>Can I redress the complaint? If so, take steps to redress the complaint. You can appoint a second person to investigate the complaint on your behalf if necessary.</li><li>Is it necessary to elevate the complaint and refer it to the CO for investigation?</li></ul><p>The investigation is to commence within 5 working days of receiving the complaint. If it is considered likely that the investigation will take longer than 5 days to conclude, the complainant is to be notified. It is important that both the divisional member and CO are kept updated on progress regularly. As the Investigating Officer, the DO is responsible for recording the complaint in the unit's Complaints Register.</p><p>The Investigating Officer has the authority to gather information from anyone who may have information pertaining to the complaint. However, should information need to be sought from outside the command's jurisdiction or the RNZN, command approval needs to be obtained.</p><p>Should, during the investigation, the Investigating Officer determine that some form of disciplinary action may be taken against a Service member as a result of the information being gathered, the CO must be advised.</p>"

                "content": "<h3>Preparing a Will</h3><p>A Will is a clear and legal record of a person's wishes. It lets you decide what should happen after your death by stipulating how your assets are to be administered. The death of any individual usually involves distress and stress for family and friends. Preparing a Will will encourage you to think about what you want to happen, not just in respect of money and other assets, but also the future of any children and the needs of other relations and dependents.</p><p>Should you die without a Will (intestate), the executors of the estate are required to ensure the estate is allocated to the individuals recognised by law as the beneficiaries. This may involve the NoK having to obtain legal advice to ensure your wishes are met. Administration of the estate is likely to be more time consuming and significantly more expensive. This could create financial hardships and practical hardships for dependants, in addition to the inevitable stress associated with death.</p><p>A Will must be in writing, dated and signed by the person making the Will and two witnesses who are not beneficiaries of the Will. It is your responsibility to make a Will, not the responsibility of the RNZN/NZDF. Wherever possible, a Will prepared by a legally qualified person should be made.</p><p>The NZDF has developed the MD7 form for personnel deployed/about to deploy who do not have the opportunity to have a formal Will prepared.</p><p>The NZDF Force Financial Hub (in partnership with the electronic branch of Perpetual Guardian <a href='https://www.myfootprint.co.nz/will-it-package'>https://www.myfootprint.co.nz/will-it-package</a>) also offers a Will service to NZDF members and partners.</p><p>As a Regular Force or Civilian member of NZDF, you get a free Will for yourself and your spouse through AON for the first year as this is a subscription service. You get:</p><ul><li>An online Will</li><li>A secure digital vault</li><li>Physical storage of your original Will</li><li>Will notifications</li></ul><p>Under this arrangement, you select your preferred executor. One of the options is to select Perpetual Guardian as the executor, and if so, you have the choice of paying 2% of the total value of your estate or paying on a time basis i.e. charged an hourly rate. Most estates are not complex and therefore you may be best to opt for the hourly rate for a total cost of approx. $1,000-$1,500. If you opt for the 2%, your estate would pay at least $6,000 (as all serving members have $300,000 life insurance as part of your estate).</p><p>Form MD1335 - Update of Official Personal Details, is not a Will, nor is the editing of NoK details on ESS. Personnel nominated as NoKs are not necessarily entitled to receive the reserved effects such as superannuation and insurance in the event of death.</p><h4>Superannuation implications</h4><p>The insurer for the NZDF schemes has an obligation to ensure that any approved death payment is made to the deceased's intended beneficiaries. A valid Will aids this process, facilitating prompt payment of any death claim accepted by the insurer.</p><ul><li>For those on the Kiwisaver superannuation scheme, upon death the funds in a member's accounts are paid in full to the member's &quot;personal representative&quot; as stipulated on their application documentation. A valid Will will help confirm who is the designated &quot;personal representative&quot;.</li><li>Similarly for those on the DFSS Category B scheme, ensuring that form DF2 Eligible</li></ul><p>Beneficiaries is completed and up to date will assist to ensure their wishes are adhered to.</p><h3>Powers of Attorney</h3><p>A power of attorney (POA) is an authority that a person gives to another person to act on their behalf.</p><p>A POA should stipulate:</p><ul><li>the date the power was given</li><li>who gave the power</li><li>who the power was given to</li><li>what the authorised person is allowed to do</li></ul><p>The relevant type of POA in the case of a divisional member, is an Ordinary POA.</p><img src='https://oracle-static.aviato.co.nz/content/wills-powers-of-attorney-table-1.png' /><p>The NZDF provides a discounted POA service through Perpetual Guardian (in partnership with the electronic branch of Perpetual Guardian <a href='https://www.myfootprint.co.nz'>www.myfootprint.co.nz</a>).

Hair is to be neat, of one colour or lightly tipped and clean. Exaggerated hairstyles i.e. having partially shaven head, mohawks, mullets, undercuts and zigzagging of hair is not permitted.</p><ul><li>Hair is not to be cut shorter than a number one comb i.e. shaved head, unless a request has been submitted to your DO. The approval process is outlined below. Once approved, and if you wish to grow your hair again, you must seek permission by following the approval process again..Short hair is not to be worn in styles that extend below the lower edge of the collar.</li><li>Long hair is to be worn in a bun with a bun net, in a french roll variant of a bun, or in a single plait that extends below the collar line. Note: A single plait is not to be worn when on parade or wearing uniforms 1A/1AW, 1B/1BW, and 1C/1CW.</li></ul><h3>Facial hair</h3><p>You may request to grow a beard, moustache or both. When permission to grow facial hair has been given by your DO, the use of the razor is to be discontinued except for the removal of untidy growth at the extremities of the beard or moustache, in particular on the lower neck region. Your DO will then review the growth after three weeks and, based on appearance, either approve the facial hair to remain or order the removal of facial hair.</p><img src='https://oracle-static.aviato.co.nz/content/hair-facial-hair-diagram-1.png' /><img src='https://oracle-static.aviato.co.nz/content/hair-facial-hair-table-1.png' /><p>Once approved, and if you wish to commence shaving again, you must seek permission by following the approval process again.</p>"

Regardless of the scheme of study being undertaken (ESA or self-funded study), time off duty to attend lectures is to be approved only if alternative lectures are not available outside of normal working hours.</p><h4>Q.

Given that these are exceptional circumstances that cannot be controlled, most tertiary providers will allow an application to be made for permission to sit the examination(s) at another time or at another location in New Zealand or overseas. As long as the invigilator agrees to the assessment regulations stipulated by the respective institution, there is rarely an issue with having an officer onboard to invigilate an examination. </p>"

The signal will list the branches that are open for nominations i.e. not every branch will have space to take CFR candidates every rotation. There may also be some branch pre-requisites for nomination i.e. GLE(WE/ME) may require candidates to already possess a 4 year degree to meet the academic requirement. If a candidate does not have the relevant tertiary qualification, they must be trained through the Midshipman Tertiary Scheme in order to gain the necessary qualification. GL(E) and GL(S) candidates may request to be considered for the Midshipman (Tertiary) Scheme; limited to two places per year.</p><p>Refer to NZBR 8 for information on branch-specific professional qualification requirements.</p><h4>Step 2 - Submitting a nomination</h4><p>The primary point of contact and facilitator throughout this step is the Organisational Psychology Department Administrator.</p><img src='https://oracle-static.aviato.co.nz/content/commissioning-from-ranks-table-1.png' /><p>If the request is recommended by your DO:</p><img src='https://oracle-static.aviato.co.nz/content/commissioning-from-ranks-table-2.png' /><p>If the request is recommended by your CO:</p><img src='https://oracle-static.aviato.co.nz/content/commissioning-from-ranks-table-3.png' /><h4>Step 3 - Paper Selection Board</h4><p>The Paper Selection Board comprises an education officer and a psychologist. They will review the candidates' documentation and make a recommendation as to whether the candidate is to present at the full Officer Selection Board. The Paper Selection Board will consider all previous PDRs as well as past RNZN 184s (PCRs), MD68s (for WOs) and associated retrospective Appendix Bs during their deliberations.</p><h4>Step 4 - Final Officer Selection Board (FOSB)</h4><p>Candidates successful at the Paper Board will be required to attend a FOSB. The format is a 2-day Board comprising a variety of mental, physical and leadership activities, and a panel interview. Candidates are observed throughout the entirety and debriefed on completion.</p><h4>Step 5 - Offer of Service</h4><img src='https://oracle-static.aviato.co.nz/content/commissioning-from-ranks-table-4.png' /><h3>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h3><p><strong>Q. What if I'm unable to appear before the FOSB?</strong><br />If you are unable to appear due to the exigencies of the Service, the decision on eligibility to commission will be postponed until you are able to appear before the FOSB. If there is a time delay between attendance at the Papers Selection Board and the FOSB, updated information (e.g. last PDR or attached suitability Minute) will be required prior to your attendance at the FOSB.</p><p><strong>Q. If a Board deems me 'unsuitable' to CFR, can I apply again?</strong><br />Feedback and guidance will be provided by the Board but candidates are not typically precluded from reapplying and reappearing if subsequently recommended by their CO, and are otherwise eligible.</p>"

The chevron was a basic part of the colourful and complicated science of heraldry.  It appeared on the shields and coats-of-arms of knights, barons and kings. Chevrons were thus easily recognised symbols of honour. French soldiers started wearing cloth chevrons in 1977 as length of service and good conduct badges. Some British units also used them to show length of service.  In 1803 the British began using chevrons with the points down as rank insignia. Sergeants wore three and Corporals two. The chevrons first appeared on the cuffs of sailors' jumpers in 1886 (US Navy). Shortly after WWII the Navy moved the stripes to its Seamens' upper arms.</p><p>A Good Conduct Badge is awarded at the CO's discretion to ratings qualified by service and conduct. They are awarded for continuous service and unblemished conduct. The following length of service is required for the award of GCBs:</p><p><strong>1st badge - 4 years</strong><br /><strong>2nd badge - 8 years</strong><br /><strong>3rd badge - 12 years</strong></p><p>Your entire service in the RNZN counts as qualifying service. The only exceptions to this are time in imprisonment/detention/desertion or awaiting trial, time under training as a reservist, time served before being absent from the Service for 5 years or more, and LWOP over 91 days.</p><p>In addition to these periods of service, you must also qualify by conduct before being considered for the award of a badge. Conduct is your day to day behaviour. Since Nov 07, the standard of conduct for the award of GCBs changed from 'irreproachable conduct' to 'Very Good Conduct' (VG conduct).</p><p>The minimum requirement is two years of VG conduct immediately prior to the award of a badge. For the award of the 2nd and 3rd badge, you must also have been in possession of the preceding badge for 12 months.</p>"

There is no guarantee that such a request will be approved. For example, a request to withdraw notice may be declined on the basis that your service has not been entirely satisfactory, or replacement posting action has already been initiated and no suitable alternative posting is available.</p><p>If you are unmarried and under the age of 18, your parent or guardian is to be informed (by the initiating unit) of the date of release/discharge/dismissal and brief details of the cause.  Should you not consent to this, your refusal is to be recorded and no information will be forwarded.</p><h3>Leave owing</h3><p>A 'Grant in Lieu of Leave (GILL)' is a payment made on the terminal date.  Outstanding and accumulated Annual Leave and outstanding Equivalent Leave, is payable as a Grant.  Long Leave, Incentive Leave and Stand-down Leave is not payable as a Grant.  For the valid leave, the individual will be paid out at rate of 1.4 times the number of days.  This is 1.4 times the daily rate of pay as at the terminal date.  It is subject to PAYE tax deductions but not superannuation deductions.</p><p>For information pertaining to situations where leave is overdrawn at the time of release or you wish to waive your accrued leave, see DFO 4 Chapter 16, Section 13.</p><h3>Reserve liability</h3><p>All personnel released from the RNZN are transferred to the Reserves.  The minimum periods of Reserve liability are:<ul><li>Less than 20 years service - 4 years</li><li>20+ years service - 2 years</li></ul><br/>Exempt from this obligation are those aged 60+ years, dismissed or discharged personnel, and those who did not meet the required medical standard prior to release.</p><h3>Records & Certificates of Service</h3><p>On release or discharge from the RNZN, Regular Force members will receive, and Reservists can request, the following documents recording their Service career:<ul><li>Record of Service in the RNZN/New Zealand Armed Forces (&lt;1 year Service)<br/><ul><li>Service description</li><li>Length of service</li><li>Record of rank and trade changes (including acting rank and reduction/reversion);</li><li>Educational, technical and professional qualifications attained</li><li>Courses completed/attended</li><li>Honours, medals, awards, clasps, mentioned in dispatches, commendations and citation</li></ul></li><li>Certificate of Service in the RNZN/New Zealand Armed Forces (&gt;1 year Service)<br/><ul><li>Details the dates you served.</li></ul></ul>In addition to receiving one of these documents, you will also receive a Statement of Service which outlines your trade role and rank expectations.</p><p>The purpose of these documents is to provide a record of performance and also provide information that could be of assistance in attaining civilian employment. Ideally, you will receive these documents prior to your final day in the NZDF. If not, they will be sent to your release address.</p><p>If you are requested to write a personal testimonial for a Service member, be aware that you cannot provide detailed employment information; you can only comment on the individual's character and suitability for civilian employment. A personal testimonial is not allowed to be printed on RNZN letterhead as it is a personal rather than the official opinion.</p>"

Challenging pursuits are activities that are not directly related to participants' primary duties; they should stretch participants' outside their comfort zones. Activities that have typically been approved within Navy as 'challenging pursuits' are listed in NZBR 21 i.e. sailing, tramping, sea kayaking, rock climbing, abseiling, etc.</p><p>The running of the exped is conducted by the unit, and activities that are considered 'adventurous' are conducted by recognised civilian operators who have an audited safety management sytem. Wherever possible, existing NZDF resources should be utilised. Assistance in organising a divisional adventurous exped can be sought from the PTI trade.</p><ul><li>Approval will not normally be granted for more than 1 exped per year.</li><li>Unless otherwise approved, expeds should not exceed 15 working days. (Note: 10 working days will be granted and the remainder will be annual leave).</li></ul><h4>Recreational activities</h4><p>Recreational team building activities are defined as activities which are not classified as 'approved sport' or 'adventurous training'. They encompass a wide range of activities including white water rafting, water skiing, snow/downhill skiing and snowboarding, fishing, organised day walks on marked tracks, and others at the discretion of your CO. These activities are not normally Service conducted but may be arranged through civilian providers as long as there are qualified instructors present and the aims of adventure training are met.</p><ul><li>Approval will not normally be granted for more than 2 recreational activities per year.</li><li>Unless otherwise approved, expeds should not exceed 2 working days excluding travel.</li></ul><h3>Funding</h3><ul><li>Approved expeds and recreational activities cover participants' activities, food and accommodation costs at public expense, as they are considered to be on duty for the expeds duration.</li><li>Travel during working hours can be covered at public expense.

Consequently, it is everyone's responsibility to ensure that a divisional meeting is successful and does not deprive you and your fellow divisional members of valuable time. All divisional members, whether conducting the meeting or attending them can make important contributions. Improving the quality of meetings is the responsibility of the entire division.

This concept of everyone coaching each other is what is referred to as a 'coaching culture' or being more 'coach-like'.</p><p><strong>Be 'Coach-Like'</strong> - An organisation with a coaching culture can be described as one which adopts coaching principles as an integral way of managing and developing people. It recognises the value of using coaching principles as an approach to grow and develop its people in order to grow and develop the organisation itself. Being 'coach-like' means using coaching principles with each other as a natural part of meetings, reviews, and one-to-one discussions of all kinds.</p><p>It's about asking questions rather than jumping to telling an answer, it's about really listening, not just listening to formulate a response, and it's about being genuinely curious as to what the other person is saying and helping them through your questions to find the answers themselves. It's only by using these techniques and demonstrating these coaching behaviours that we can fully understand a person's challenge and provide help.</p><p><strong>Leaders as Coaches</strong> - All leaders need to engage in coaching in the workplace for specific performance outcomes. Those who are 1Ups, supervisors, instructors, Career Managers, and DOs/Div Supervisors, fall in to this category. In order to develop our people, we have to actively support their development. On the whole the Navy uses an apprenticeship model, we teach our own. Starting at day one, we are learning about our trade, and honing our craft. As we gain more knowledge and experience, being coached on how we're performing is essential for becoming more effective at our role. We need our leaders to coach us; and as leaders, we need to coach our direct reports.</p><h4>Benefits of Coaching</h4><ul><li>Performance/Skills improvement.</li><li>Well-being: People work better if they feel well, basic needs are met, and they do not struggle with health-related problems caused by the job.</li><li>Helps build ways of coping with stressors.</li><li>Increases job satisfaction: In a workplace where a lot of the time we cannot change things about our tasks or interactions, being able to ';re-frame' our work experiences and attitudes can help us remain positive.</li><li>Setting and striving for goals.</li></ul>"

What does the individual hope to get from you? What do they hope to achieve in your conversation? This allows you to limit what you are responsible for, and what they are responsible for.<strong> You are not there to work on their goals for them.</strong> You are there to facilitate their thinking. You can establish this with the following questions:</li></ul><p><strong>What would make this session worthwhile for you?</strong></p><p><strong>What do you hope we can achieve together today?</strong></p><p><strong>How can we make this conversation useful for you?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Your goal for the individual.</strong> As a DO/Div Supervisor you might have your own agenda about what needs to be achieved in the conversation. It is helpful if both you and your divisional member are on the same page about this - so you need to be upfront at the start of the conversation! Tell your divisional member what you hope to achieve. If you have a goal for the individual, for example you need them to prepare more thoroughly for an upcoming assessment, or you need them to develop their interpersonal skills, then you can reverse engineer some of the solution focus techniques, by using them collaboratively with the individual. To start - build a detailed picture for the individual what <strong>success looks like to you</strong>. Outline <strong>explicitly</strong> what behaviours you would like to see.</li><li><strong>The Individual's Goal.</strong> If you are coaching, mentoring or guiding an individual you need to use conversation tools to help them develop a detailed picture of - not only what their goal is but also what it looks like. For example, a divisional member might have a goal to improve their confidence, or improve their leadership ability. These are vague terms. They describe concepts not behaviours and therefore it is difficult to picture leadership or confidence. What might be the difference if you ask the individual to build a picture of what you are doing, feeling and seeing when you are an effective leader? The difference is the goal becomes real and tangible.</li></ul>"

It is an unusual way to ask about a preferred future, but it has the benefit of sparking the imagination, and getting the person to think about the details of their preferred future. The devil is in the detail!</p><img src='https://oracle-static.aviato.co.nz/content/miracle-question-diagram-1.png' /><p>The key here is really around what will be different? What will the person be doing differently and what will the people around them notice is different? It is by identifying these small differences that the person can start to build up a repertoire of small behaviours that may make a difference in their life. What small, seemingly insignificant behaviours contribute to their world without 'performance anxiety' or their world without 'stressors' or my world without 'the conflict with my boss'? The miracle is not that the person has magically won Lotto - and therefore can quit their job. The miracle is that the conflict between the boss and the person has disappeared - so what is different? It might be that they say hello to their boss in the morning and ask about their weekend. It might be that they don't avoid the Mess outside of meal times, but go and get themselves a coffee. Small things like that. Once the picture is starting to be developed we can ask useful questions that contribute to developing this picture:</p><p>When the miracle has happened:</p><ul><li>What will you be doing differently?</li><li>What will you notice is different</li><li>What might your partner/boss/colleague notice about you?</li><li>What else?</li><li>When your partner/boss/colleague notices a change, what might they do differently too?</li><li>What difference might that make for you?</li></ul>"

This also helps mitigate the tendency to create 'all-or nothing' goals. Everything can be conceptualised on a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 is the preferred future and 1 is the worst case scenario.</p><img src='https://oracle-static.aviato.co.nz/content/scaling-questions-diagram-1.png' /><p>Scales can also be a great way to track progress. If, in the first conversation the individual places themselves at a '3' out of 10 for performance or motivation - you know that in the second session if they are a '5' you are on the right track! Conversely if they are now a '2' you might need to try something new. In relation to goals, you can set '10' up to be the achievement of the goal - or a descriptor of that achievement. Or you can ask the individual to define what '10' looks like to them.</p><p>The benefit of using the scale question is that it gives you a realistic impression of where the individual thinks they are on the journey towards the goal. As a DO/Div Supervisor, you might have a good idea of where you think the individual is. If there is a difference between your score and their score - this can be the start of a very useful conversation. Essentially it is an opportunity to get everyone on the same page, and share your expectations of where they are and where they need to be. The goal for the individual doesn't have to be a '10' on the scale. You can ask where the individual might need to get to, to feel satisfied. They might be happy to be an '8' - this might make things more achievable for them. </p><p>Once you have established where they are on the scale, then you can follow up with some useful questions that help the individual to think of the small things that contribute to being higher or lower on the scale i.e. the individual scores a '3' on their scale of assertiveness:</p><ul><li>What would you be doing differently if you were a '4' on the scale?</li><li>If you move up just one point on the scale, what would you notice was different?</li><li>What does a '4' or '5' look like?</li><li>Have you ever been a '5'? Do you remember what that looks like, or what you were doing differently?</li><li>What is the highest you have ever been on the scale? When was that? What were you doing then? How did that make things different?</li><li>What would need to happen for you to go up a point or two on the scale?</li><li>How did you get to a '3'? How come it's not '1'?</li></ul>"

This provides a safe platform for a DO, or a divisional member referred by a DO, to speak their mind without fear of being put on record. Their approach to people is always relational and practically grounded.</li></ul><br/>Chaplaincy support includes:<br/><ul><li>The availability of a Navy Padre to provide a sounding board and 'life advice' from a sailor's perspective, for the DO, CWO, XO forum onboard ship or alongside, regarding personnel issues.</li><li>The Navy Padre has the ability to be a 'go between' for the leadership team and the affected sailor/s when the situation is sensitive or communication has stalled. A Padre can often gain the permission of a divisional member to share information with Command that can augment the decision making process to the advantage of both Command and affected personnel.</li><li>The Navy Padre is an almost endless supply of sage counsel or advice but will stop short of being a 'Counsellor' in the professional sense.  The padre can be relied on to know their 'part of ship' and triage those in need of further specialist care. It must be noted that the Padre keeps a good working relationship with DHC, NCO and other providers so as to give command the widest scope of input possible for decision making.</li><li>The Padre is available to build and maintain a pastoral relationship between the DO, Divisional Supervisors and the divisional members referred for the Padre's attention.  This will provide an ongoing platform/person/place to vent frustration or share difficulty to a trained listening ear, without fear of demerit, disqualification or loss of reputation. A Padre, especially on board ship, will usually endeavour to link a young DO with a willing/helpful Senior Rating; this relationship alongside a Padre is very successful.</li><li>The Navy Padre is available to provide many ceremonial and spiritual services on request i.e. weddings, christenings, funerals and prayers on parade etc.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Contact details:</strong><br/>Phone:  <a href='tel:+6494455326'>(09) 445 5326</a> or DTel: 7326<br/>Office: The Chaplaincy Centre is located on the right-hand side just as you enter the HMNZS PHILOMEL Main Gate.<br/>Visits:  The Padre can come to your location if that is practicable.</p><h3>Maori Cultural Advisor & RNZN Marae</h3><p>The Māori Cultural Advisor and Te Taua Moana Marae staff can provide DOs, Divisional Supervisors and divisional members with advice on a wide range of cultural and practical matters:</p><ul><li>Protocol - providing advice on cultural practices appropriate to RNZN and personal activities i.e. Powhiris (welcomes) and Tangihanga (funerals)</li><li>Pastoral care - the Marae can be used to provide personnel with supported rest & respite care upon referral by the Defence Health Centre/Naval Community Organisation.</li><li>Education - developing learning opportunities within the RNZN in Māori language, tikanga and the Treaty of Waitangi.</li><li>Policy advice - advising on the implementation of RNZN and NZDF cultural policies</li><li>Liaison - liaising with local iwi and hapu</li><li>Kapa haka</li><li>Event management</li></ul><p>The mission statement for Te Taua Moana Marae is: 'To provide an understanding of Maori customs, supporting the needs of Te Taua Moana Marae, embracing a unity of all cultures within the RNZN and the wider naval community, by sharing, experiencing and respecting other's values and beliefs'.

OPEN 24/7</li></ul><h3>Chaplaincy Centre</h3><p>Navy Chaplains fully support the Divisional System, understanding that it plays a pivotal role in every sailor's ongoing development and care.</p><p>Chaplains:</p><ul><li>A Navy Chaplain (Padre), is a trained sailor and officer who is able to support Command decisions regarding the spiritual, emotional and mental welfare of sailors from the advantage of having many years of people leadership experience.</li><li>The Navy Padre has the traditional benefit of being the same rank as the person they are talking to, while remaining completely bound by professional confidentiality concerning those who approach them, unless harm is imminent, implied or intended. This provides a safe platform for a DO, or a divisional member referred by a DO, to speak their mind without fear of being put on record. Their approach to people is always relational and practically grounded.</li></ul><p>Chaplaincy support includes:</p><ul><li>The availability of a Navy Padre to provide a sounding board and 'life advice' from a sailor's perspective, for the DO, CWO, XO forum onboard ship or alongside, regarding personnel issues.</li><li>The Navy Padre has the ability to be a 'go between' for the leadership team and the affected sailor/s when the situation is sensitive or communication has stalled. A Padre can often gain the permission of a divisional member to share information with Command that can augment the decision making process to the advantage of both Command and affected personnel.</li><li>The Navy Padre is an almost endless supply of sage counsel or advice but will stop short of being a 'Counsellor' in the professional sense. The padre can be relied on to know their 'part of ship' and triage those in need of further specialist care. It must be noted that the Padre keeps a good working relationship with DHC, NCO and other providers so as to give command the widest scope of input possible for decision making.</li><li>The Padre is available to build and maintain a pastoral relationship between the DO, Divisional Supervisors and the divisional members referred for the Padre's attention. This will provide an ongoing platform/person/place to vent frustration or share difficulty to a trained listening ear, without fear of demerit, disqualification or loss of reputation. A Padre, especially on board ship, will usually endeavour to link a young DO with a willing/helpful Senior Rating; this relationship alongside a Padre is very successful.</li><li>The Navy Padre is available to provide many ceremonial and spiritual services on request i.e. weddings, christenings, funerals and prayers on parade etc.</li></ul><p><strong>Contact details:</strong></p><p>Phone: <a href='+6494455326'>(09) 445 5326</a> or DTel: 7326</p><p>Office: The Chaplaincy Centre is located on the right-hand side just as you enter the HMNZS PHILOMEL Main Gate.</p><p>Visits: The Padre can come to your location if that is practicable.</p><h3>Maori Cultural Advisor & RNZN Marae</h3><p>The Māori Cultural Advisor and Te Taua Moana Marae staff can provide DOs, Divisional Supervisors and divisional members with advice on a wide range of cultural and practical matters:</p><ul><li>Protocol - providing advice on cultural practices appropriate to RNZN and personal activities i.e. Powhiris (welcomes) and Tangihanga (funerals)</li><li>Pastoral care - the Marae can be used to provide personnel with supported rest & respite care upon referral by the Defence Health Centre/Naval Community Organisation.</li><li>Education - developing learning opportunities within the RNZN in Māori language, tikanga and the Treaty of Waitangi.</li><li>Policy advice - advising on the implementation of RNZN and NZDF cultural policies</li><li>Liaison - liaising with local iwi and hapu</li><li>Kapa haka</li><li>Event management</li></ul><p>The mission statement for Te Taua Moana Marae is: 'To provide an understanding of Maori customs, supporting the needs of Te Taua Moana Marae, embracing a unity of all cultures within the RNZN and the wider naval community, by sharing, experiencing and respecting other's values and beliefs'.
