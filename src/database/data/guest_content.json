                "content": "<h3>Protecting trade routes, preventing piracy and terrorism</h3><p>New Zealand's economic prosperity is reliant on a stable political environment and safe maritime trade routes. Nearly all of our country's exports (99% by weight) and most of our imports are transported by sea.  Threats to shipping, such as piracy or blockade, have affected our economy in the past and could do so again.</p><p>New Zealand is a valued regional security partner and our Navy works collaboratively with other Navies to protect our region's valuable maritime trade routes. In recent years Navy ships and people have deployed to the Arabian Gulf and Horn of Africa where we contribute to international efforts to protect trade routes and prevent piracy and terrorism. New Zealand continues to invest in strengthening regional architecture that helps protect the rights of small states and enhances stability, security and free access to global commons.</p><h3>Border patrol and resource protection</h3><p>Navy ships and people protect our country's interests with regular border and fisheries patrols, search and rescue operations, as well as supporting the Police, Civil Defence and the Department of Conservation.  Two Inshore Patrol Vessels work around the New Zealand coast and two Offshore Patrol Vessels do similar work in the Southern Ocean and Pacific.</p><h3>Humanitarian and Disaster Relief missions</h3><p>The Navy is ready and capable of responding to natural disasters at home and abroad.  Navy ships and people were among the first responders to the devastating Christchurch earthquake in February 2011 and again in 2016.  Navy ships are ready to undertake search and rescue missions and are active in the South Pacific where ships of the Naval Patrol Force regularly undertake fisheries patrols, visit ports and contribute to humanitarian missions such as cyclone relief or transporting supplies to remote islands, an example of this is when Cyclone Winston hit Fiji in 2015.</p><h3>Peacekeeping</h3><p>Navy personnel take part in peacekeeping operations around the world.  Navy ships and people have been deployed to Timor-Leste, Solomon Islands, Sudan, the Middle-East, South Korea and Afghanistan.</p><h3>Specialist Underwater Operations</h3><p>Navy maintains a modern, deployable specialist underwater operational and survey capability.  The Operational Dive Team and Littoral Warfare Support Force are capable of military and civilian tasks, including search and recovery, and deploy to incidents within New Zealand and overseas.</p><iframe height='300' src='https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gwUIPrERL6Y?showinfo=0&rel=0&iv_load_policy=3&color=white&disablekb=1' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe>"

We have the ninth longest coastline in the world. Our nearest major trading partner and ally, Australia, is 1,000 miles away. We are a vast distance from most major international markets and 99% of our trade crosses the sea. New Zealand's economic interests rest upon our ability to ensure safe passage at sea and the security of the waters over which we have a sovereign right. Through our geographical isolation and dependence on maritime trade, it is clear that New Zealand is a maritime nation.</p><p>The Navy's readiness to deploy provides the Government with an important tool to respond quickly to emergency situations around New Zealand's 15,000-kilometre coastline, the Southern Ocean and into the Asia-Pacific region.</p>"

The approval process is outlined below. Once approved, and if you wish to grow your hair again, you must seek permission by following the approval process again..Short hair is not to be worn in styles that extend below the lower edge of the collar.</li><li>Long hair is to be worn in a bun with a bun net, in a french roll variant of a bun, or in a single plait that extends below the collar line. Note: A single plait is not to be worn when on parade or wearing uniforms 1A/1AW, 1B/1BW, and 1C/1CW.</li></ul><h3>Facial hair</h3><p>You may request to grow a beard, moustache or both. When permission to grow facial hair has been given by your DO, the use of the razor is to be discontinued except for the removal of untidy growth at the extremities of the beard or moustache, in particular on the lower neck region.

The chevron was a basic part of the colourful and complicated science of heraldry.  It appeared on the shields and coats-of-arms of knights, barons and kings. Chevrons were thus easily recognised symbols of honour. French soldiers started wearing cloth chevrons in 1977 as length of service and good conduct badges. Some British units also used them to show length of service.  In 1803 the British began using chevrons with the points down as rank insignia. Sergeants wore three and Corporals two. The chevrons first appeared on the cuffs of sailors' jumpers in 1886 (US Navy). Shortly after WWII the Navy moved the stripes to its Seamens' upper arms.</p><p>A Good Conduct Badge is awarded at the CO's discretion to ratings qualified by service <i>and</i> conduct. They are awarded for continuous service and unblemished conduct. The following length of service is required for the award of GCBs:</p><p><strong>1st badge - 4 years</strong><br /><strong>2nd badge - 8 years</strong><br /><strong>3rd badge - 12 years</strong></p>"

OPEN 24/7</li></ul><h3>Chaplaincy Centre</h3><p>Navy Chaplains fully support the Divisional System, understanding that it plays a pivotal role in every sailor's ongoing development and care.</p><p>Chaplains:</p><ul><li>A Navy Chaplain (Padre), is a trained sailor and officer who is able to support Command decisions regarding the spiritual, emotional and mental welfare of sailors from the advantage of having many years of people leadership experience.</li><li>The Navy Padre has the traditional benefit of being the same rank as the person they are talking to, while remaining completely bound by professional confidentiality concerning those who approach them, unless harm is imminent, implied or intended. This provides a safe platform for a DO, or a divisional member referred by a DO, to speak their mind without fear of being put on record. Their approach to people is always relational and practically grounded.</li></ul><p>Chaplaincy support includes:</p><ul><li>The availability of a Navy Padre to provide a sounding board and 'life advice' from a sailor's perspective, for the DO, CWO, XO forum onboard ship or alongside, regarding personnel issues.</li><li>The Navy Padre has the ability to be a 'go between' for the leadership team and the affected sailor/s when the situation is sensitive or communication has stalled. A Padre can often gain the permission of a divisional member to share information with Command that can augment the decision making process to the advantage of both Command and affected personnel.</li><li>The Navy Padre is an almost endless supply of sage counsel or advice but will stop short of being a 'Counsellor' in the professional sense. The padre can be relied on to know their 'part of ship' and triage those in need of further specialist care. It must be noted that the Padre keeps a good working relationship with DHC, NCO and other providers so as to give command the widest scope of input possible for decision making.</li><li>The Padre is available to build and maintain a pastoral relationship between the DO, Divisional Supervisors and the divisional members referred for the Padre's attention. This will provide an ongoing platform/person/place to vent frustration or share difficulty to a trained listening ear, without fear of demerit, disqualification or loss of reputation. A Padre, especially on board ship, will usually endeavour to link a young DO with a willing/helpful Senior Rating; this relationship alongside a Padre is very successful.</li><li>The Navy Padre is available to provide many ceremonial and spiritual services on request i.e. weddings, christenings, funerals and prayers on parade etc.</li></ul><p><strong>Contact details:</strong></p><p>Phone: <a href='+6494455326'>(09) 445 5326</a> or DTel: 7326</p><p>Office: The Chaplaincy Centre is located on the right-hand side just as you enter the HMNZS PHILOMEL Main Gate.</p><p>Visits: The Padre can come to your location if that is practicable.</p><h3>Maori Cultural Advisor & RNZN Marae</h3><p>The Māori Cultural Advisor and Te Taua Moana Marae staff can provide DOs, Divisional Supervisors and divisional members with advice on a wide range of cultural and practical matters:</p><ul><li>Protocol - providing advice on cultural practices appropriate to RNZN and personal activities i.e. Powhiris (welcomes) and Tangihanga (funerals)</li><li>Pastoral care - the Marae can be used to provide personnel with supported rest & respite care upon referral by the Defence Health Centre/Naval Community Organisation.</li><li>Education - developing learning opportunities within the RNZN in Māori language, tikanga and the Treaty of Waitangi.</li><li>Policy advice - advising on the implementation of RNZN and NZDF cultural policies</li><li>Liaison - liaising with local iwi and hapu</li><li>Kapa haka</li><li>Event management</li></ul><p>The mission statement for Te Taua Moana Marae is: 'To provide an understanding of Maori customs, supporting the needs of Te Taua Moana Marae, embracing a unity of all cultures within the RNZN and the wider naval community, by sharing, experiencing and respecting other's values and beliefs'.

A successful mentoring relationship will result in more informed choices, an action plan, and increased alternatives.</p><p>To become a registered mentor, you must attend a half day workshop. The workshops are open to all RNZN personnel, all ranks and NZDF Civilians. To register, email either address below with your 1-Up Manager cc'd on the email.</p><p>To become a mentee, email either address below to register.</p><p>Location: Leadership Development Group, North Yard</p><p>Emails: RNZN Mentoring inbox <a href='mailto:RNZNMentoringCoord@nzdf.mil.nz'>RNZNMentoringCoord@nzdf.mil.nz</a></p><p>WO Leadership Development <a href='mailto:WOLD@nzdf.mil.nz'>WOLD@nzdf.mil.nz</a></p><h3>Inside Out Meetings</h3><p>Inside Out provides a welcoming and comfortable space that gives the opportunity to share your story in a supportive environment. This is an environment that is non-judgemental, non-clinical and appropriately safe.
